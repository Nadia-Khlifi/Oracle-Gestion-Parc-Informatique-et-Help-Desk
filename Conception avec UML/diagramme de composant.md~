|Optional Model:
|The business modeling workflow in Rational Unified Process produces two models: the business use-case model, and the business object model. Both show the business 
|processes, but different aspects of them. In the business use-case model each business use case represents a business process, described (text and/or activity diagrams) from an "external" view point without worrying about who does what to whom inside of the organization. 
|In the business object model, you include realizations of each business use case to show how workers and entities collaborate to perform the process. You do that using class diagrams, activity diagrams with swimlanes, collaboration diagrams, and/or interaction diagrams.

|
|The business modeling workflow in Rational Unified Process produces two models: the business use-case model, and the business object model. Both show the business

|In the business object model, you include realizations of each business use case to show how workers and entities collaborate to perform the process. You do that using class diagrams, activity diagrams with swimlanes, collaboration diagrams, and/or interaction diagrams.

|The Design Model in Rational Unified Process.
|The design model is adapted to model the real implementation environment, and serves as an abstraction of the source code. It is a "blueprint" of how the source code is structured and written. 
|
|The design model is a hierarchy of packages (design subsystems and design-service  packages), with "leaves" that are classes. Subsystems are a design "view" of the components that are defined in the Implementation Model.
|
|The design model hierarchy consists of layers. 
|
|Classes represent abstractions of classes in the system's implementation. They define the objects, which in turn are abstractions of the objects in the system's implementation. The use cases are realized by the objects, and this is represented by use-case realizations in the Design Model.  Each use-case realization has a realize dependency to a use case in the Use-Case Model.

|The Implementation Model in Rational Unified Process is a collection of components, and the implementation subsystems that contain them.
|
|An architectural view that describes one or several system configurations; the mapping of software components (tasks, modules) to the computing nodes in these configurations.
|
|Defines, executables, dll's, files, subsystems, compilation order etc.
|
|Rational Unified Process:
|Activity: Define the Organization of Subsystems
|
|These diagram will be presented in the  Implementation  View section in the document generated using the SoDA Software Architecture Document.
|
|It is recommended that, in most cases, the mapping should be
|1:1 between design and implementation, that is, for each package in design there is one subsystem in the implementation model.
